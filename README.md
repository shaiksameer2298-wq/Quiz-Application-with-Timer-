🧠 Java Quiz Application with Timer

A desktop-based quiz application developed using Java and Swing, designed to deliver a smooth, timed quiz experience with automatic navigation, real-time scoring, and clean object-oriented architecture.

🚀 Project Overview

The Java Quiz Application with Timer is a standalone desktop application that enables users to take a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. The system automatically handles question navigation, score calculation, and time constraints, ensuring an engaging and error-free user experience.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in Java programming, Swing-based GUI development, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

✨ Key Features

⏱️ Timer-Based Quiz Flow
Each question is time-bound, with automatic transition on timeout.

🖥️ Interactive Java Swing UI
Clean and responsive GUI using Swing components and event handling.

📊 Real-Time Score Tracking
Score is calculated and updated dynamically as the quiz progresses.

🔄 Automatic Question Navigation
Eliminates manual errors and improves user flow.

🧩 OOP-Based Architecture
Modular design for question loading, validation, and persistence.

✅ Scalable Question Management
Handles 10+ questions efficiently with validation logic.
